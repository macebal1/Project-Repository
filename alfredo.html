        <p>
          I aspired to be a pro baseball player, and I trained all my high
          school to achieve my optimal physical condition. Hello! My name is
          Alfredo Acebal, and this is my story…
        </p>
        <p>
          Since my teenage years, in which I went to finish my high school
          degree abroad at IMG Academies in Bradenton, Florida, I have been
          concerned with my health and fitness. Becoming a baseball player
          involved healthy nutrition, intense training, and a balanced mindset.
          My day consisted of baseball, training, eating, studying, and
          sleeping. However, as the years passed I became more involved in the
          family business and training and baseball were not necessarily the top
          priority. Finding time to fit an 8-5 job while playing and training
          was too complicated. Notwithstanding that, my dream of becoming pro
          seemed farther and farther every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          This being said, I went abroad again to Boston, Massachusetts to
          pursue my undergraduate career at Suffolk University. At the time,
          this is what I thought: “I have spent so much of my time and energy
          into training, and I did not make it, so this lifestyle of mine is
          over”. My days now consisted of eating unhealthy and watching
          television. It was a shocking transformation for me and for those who
          surrounded me as well. Six years passed, and I had not stepped foot on
          a gym or on a baseball field. Physically, I looked unhealthy;
          mentally, I was not happy with my habits and who I had let myself
          become. I was handling too much stress, but I was not coping with it
          in a healthy way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, at the age of 26, I am the best version of myself. About a year
          ago, I reintroduced myself in the gym, and about 4 months ago I
          started what would be the best lifestyle I could follow. It all
          started by acknowledging the connotation of the word “diet” and making
          sure I said “lifestyle” every time I thought of this. I have to
          recognize, however, that the process has not been easy. Getting back
          on track to becoming the best version of myself physically and
          mentally has been a long journey involving all my commitment,
          dedication, and constancy. And that has been my biggest lesson through
          this all: there will be hard days, but slow and steady wins the race.
        </p>
        <p>
          What my sister and I have created here in terms of content, we hope
          will inspire you and motivate you to start become your best version
          yet, and to make sure it lasts! We hope you enjoy!
