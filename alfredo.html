          About Me - Alfredo Acebal
        </h3>
        <p>
          I aspired to be a pro baseball player, and I trained all my high
          school to achieve my optimal physical condition. Hello! My name is
          Alfredo Acebal, and this is my story…
        </p>
        <p>
          Since my teenage years, in which I went to finish my high school
          degree abroad at IMG Academies in Bradenton, Florida, I have been
          concerned with my health and fitness. Becoming a baseball player
          involved healthy nutrition, intense training, and a balanced mindset.
          My day consisted of baseball, training, eating, studying, and
          sleeping. However, as the years passed I became more involved in the
          family business and training and baseball were not necessarily the top
          priority. Finding time to fit an 8-5 job while playing and training
          was too complicated. Notwithstanding that, my dream of becoming pro
          seemed farther and farther every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          This being said, I went abroad again to Boston, Massachusetts to
          pursue my undergraduate career at Suffolk University. At the time,
          this is what I thought: “I have spent so much of my time and energy
          into training, and I did not make it, so this lifestyle of mine is
          over”. My days now consisted of eating unhealthy and watching
          television. It was a shocking transformation for me and for those who
          surrounded me as well. Six years passed, and I had not stepped foot on
          a gym or on a baseball field. Physically, I looked unhealthy;
          mentally, I was not happy with my habits and who I had let myself
          become. I was handling too much stress, but I was not coping with it
          in a healthy way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, at the age of 26, I am the best version of myself. About a year
          ago, I reintroduced myself in the gym, and about 4 months ago I
          started what would be the best lifestyle I could follow. It all
          started by acknowledging the connotation of the word “diet” and making
          sure I said “lifestyle” every time I thought of this. I have to
          recognize, however, that the process has not been easy. Getting back
          on track to becoming the best version of myself physically and
          mentally has been a long journey involving all my commitment,
          dedication, and constancy. And that has been my biggest lesson through
          this all: there will be hard days, but slow and steady wins the race.
