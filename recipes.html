          How We Eat on a Daily Basis
          <li>
            Every person has their own personal theories on what is a balanced
            diet, so we are not saying this is THE best way to eat, it is just
            the one that has had better results and that we have researched the
            most throughout our journey. We have come to the conclusion that
            carbohydrates should not be the main source of calories on every day
            meals because the human body has no physiological need for them, so
            we rely on a process called “carb cycling” in which we intake
            carbohydrates every 3-4 days on our meal plans and only during
            dinner. We also believe in the power of food combining, so whenever
            we eat carbohydrates we only combine it with an animal protein
            source.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our meal plans consist of a very high protein intake, a very high
            vegetable intake, a moderate fat intake, and a minimal carbohydrate
            intake
          </li>
          <!-- TODO: take professional images of these 4 meals -->
          <li>
            Our typical breakfast looks like  (IMAGE) Protein and Nut breakfast
          </li>
          <li>
            Our typical lunch plate looks like  (IMAGE) Protein, Avocado, and
            Vegetables
          </li>
          <li>
            Our typical dinner plate looks like  (IMAGE) Protein, Avocado, and
            Vegetables
          </li>
          <li>
            However, on carb days it may look like this  (IMAGE) Protein and
            Rice
          </li>
          <li>
            We don’t snack whatsoever
          </li>
          <li>
            Unlimited coffee or tea
          </li>
          <li>
            3-4 liters of water a day
          </li>
          <li>
            Every morning we drink lemon water on an empty stomach.
          </li>
          <li>
            We serve our plate once, and that it is!
          </li>
          <li>
            A little piece of dark chocolate (70% or more) after lunch and
            dinner
          </li>
          <li>
            A glass of wine with dinner is sometimes craved, so we switch it out
            with the chocolate for that meal

          <ul>
            Ingredients
            <li>1/3 Cup Chia Seeds</li>
            <li>3/4 Cups of Water</li>
            <li>2/3 Cups Pumpkin Seeds</li>
            <li>1/3 Cup Sesame Seeds (Black)</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup Sesame Seeds (White)</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup Flax Seeds OR Flax Meal</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
          </ul>
          <ol>
            Preparation
            <li>
              Preheat the oven to 325°F (165°C)
            </li>
            <li>
              In a medium bowl, add the chia seeds and the water. Mix them well
              and let sit for about 5 minutes. A gelatinous texture should be
              reached
            </li>
            <li>
              In another large bowl, add the pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds (black
              and white), flax seeds, salt and pepper and mix them well
            </li>
            <li>
              Transfer the chia seed gelatin mixture into the large bowl and mix
              all ingredients well
            </li>
            <li>
              Then, transfer the mixture onto a parchment paper-lined baking
              sheet with a spatula and spread it into a thin even layer
            </li>
            <li>
              Bake them for 30 minutes and remove them from the oven
            </li>
            <li>
              Cut into the desired shape of your crackers (squared recommended)
              and carefully flip each cracker
            </li>
            <li>
              After flipping, bake for an additional 25 minutes
            </li>
            <li>
              Remove from the oven and allow the crackers to cool for around 10
              minutes

          <ul>
            Ingredients
            <li>1 1/4 Cups Sliced/Crushed Almonds</li>
            <li>1/3 Cup Almond Butter</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon of Coconut Oil</li>
            <li>
              1/2 Cup Sugar-Free Chocolate Chips (Could also be dark chocolate
              bar chopped in small pieces)
            </li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon Chia Seeds</li>
          </ul>
          <ol>
            Preparation
            <li>
              Cover a large plate or board with parchment paper and place it in
              the freezer while you prepare the batter
            </li>
            <li>
              In a bowl (microwave save) add the almond butter, coconut oil, and
              sugar-free chocolate chips.
            </li>
            <li>
              Microwave the ingredients. However, every 30 seconds stir the mix
              to avoid the almond butter or chocolate from burning. The mixture
              should be fully combined and melted.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you don’t have access to a microwave, place all the ingredients
              in a small saucepan under medium heat and stir at all times until
              the chocolate melts and the ingredients are fully combined
            </li>
            <li>
              Transfer the sliced almonds and chia seeds into the mixture making
              sure that the almonds and the seeds are fully covered with the
              mixture
            </li>
            <li>
              Remove the place from the freezer
            </li>
            <li>
              Spoon the batter with the size of the cookie desired and place it
              on the cold plate (over the parchment paper to avoid sticking).
              Since the plate is cold, the cookie should not expand too much and
              the bottom part should set pretty fast on the plate. Leave some
              space between each cookie as a preventative measure. Repeat this
              process until there is no more batter left.
            </li>
            <li>
              Place the plate with the cookies in the freezer for about 10
              minutes or when you see that the chocolate has set and is firm
            </li>
            <li>
              Store the cookies in an air tight container in the fridge so that
              they are crunchy

            Ingredients
            <li>1 Large Bag Raw Almonds (around 5 cups)</li>
          </ul>
          <ol>
            Preparation
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C)</li>
            <li>
              Place the almonds on a large tray, and once the oven is hot, place
              them in the oven for 15-20 minutes or until they have turned
              golden
            </li>
            <li>
              Transfer the almonds carefully into a food processor and start
              blending on high speed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stop occasionally to clean the borders of the processor
            </li>
            <li>
              Nuts take time to release their own oils, so pay attention to when
              the mixture starts to blend and become butter.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the desired consistency is achieved, transfer your butter
              into a container with lid and don’t cover until the mixture is
              cooled
            </li>
