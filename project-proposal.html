        <h3>What is my website about?</h3>
        <p>For this project I will be creating a fitness progress blog. The website will consist of personal stories, healthy recipes, workout routines, interesting reading finds, and more. The site will also have personal value attached to it, as this is a subject I really enjoy and can relate to. Recently, I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and this has led me to change my eating and fitness habits. This being said, my website is about tracking this progress and how I work on becoming a more mindful human through wellness and fitness. Additionally, I will be uploading all personal material, such as the recipes and the workouts that my brother and I create at home. This will give the website a personal and creative feel. I expect to have an overall clean feel throughout the website.</p>

    <h3>What is the objective of my website?</h3>
    <p>The objective of my website is to share information on how to make healthy habits become a lifetime. However, the difference and the importance of my website lies on the fact that I will be partaking in this transformation myself. I believe this will be crucial for my target audience, as they will have concrete evidence of my progress for their reference, as well as tips on how to make this lifestyle. </p>

    <h3>Who is my target audience?</h3>
    <p>My target audience set is young adults, like myself, that are interested in their health and wellbeing, and that despite medical conditions, they want to work on becoming the best version of themselves. Since this is my target audience, I want to make information readily available and easy to access because our generation is used to having everything at our fingertips. </p>

    <h3>What content do I plan to include in each page of my website?</h3>
    <p>In my website I plan to have different pages related to the main subject. These pages, for now, will be: About Me and My Story, Personal Recipes, Workout Routines, and Interesting Finds and More. In each of these pages I plan to include the relevant content for my audience.</p>
        
            <ul>About Me and My Story
                <li class="description">On this page I plan to talk about my journey with weight and fitness since a young girl and how I have managed to work on my mind throughout the years. I will tell my story to my target audience. </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>Personal Recipes
                <li class="description">on this page I plan to share with people my favorite sweet and salty recipes, as well as how I make my homemade milks and nut butters. This section will be full of personal images and content. </li>
            </ul> 
            <ul>Workout Routines
                <li class="description">Starting my website I will start to record my personal at home workout routines as well as running intervals that help me stay sane even through stressful times. The content will be in text form as well as an inventory of videos that show how to make all exercises that will be exposed in the routines. </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>Interesting Finds and More
                <li class="description">On this specific section of the webpage, I plan to include books that I have found personally interesting with regards to a healthy lifestyle. I also plan to include any articles that seem interesting and that relate to the idea of living a “whole” and healthy life. </li>
