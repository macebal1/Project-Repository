          About Me - Mariella Acebal
        </h3>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Mariella Acebal and I am 20 years old. The purpose
          of telling you my story is to tell you a bit about myself and my
          background as well as how I got so passionate about pursuing a healthy
          lifestyle. I hope my workouts and recipes serve as inspiration and
          motivation to start taking care of your body and health. I was born
          and raised in the Dominican Republic, and then I moved to Boston,
          Massachusetts to pursue my undergraduate degree at Babson College.
          Since high school, I battled a lot with my weight and with the way I
          felt with my body. After trying all types of fad diets, no matter how
          much exercise I did, I never seemed to shed the weight I wanted off. I
          was then diagnosed with hypothyroidism and prescribed some pills that
          would regulate my body hormones. In my ideal world, this was the
          recipe to shed all the weight I had previously wanted to. Little did I
          know that this was not the solution. Transitioning into college and
          living abroad for the first time was very stressful and my body
          started this rollercoaster weight loss and weight gain process. Due to
          this, I began all these fad diets once again and changed them every
          week because I never saw the results I wanted. Fast forward three
          years, and I am now where I wanted to be years ago and in the best
          mental and physical condition I have ever been. I have learned a lot
          throughout this long journey. Most importantly, that it takes time,
          effort, and consistency to achieve your goals. All the extreme fad
          diets I was doing, such as living on protein only for 20 days or even
          a caloric deficit of about 500 calories a day, were definitely not the
          right way to lose weight mentally and to perform well physically.
          About three months ago, amid the Coronavirus pandemic that I had to
          travel back home, my brother inspired me to start changing my mindset.
          He made me see what I considered “dieting” a lifestyle. Once I
          accepted this, my transformation has been tremendous. Mentally, I am
          more aware of how my body feels and less worried about the number on
          the scale. Physically, I am eating the foods that allow me to perform
          with the best energy during my long runs and workouts, and my body
          looks leaner every day. With this I get to my main point: our body
          needs us to be patient, and our minds can be our worst enemy at times.
          We have to learn to control our minds and to love our bodies. It took
          me too much time to realize this, and I just hope that my story helps
          you realize this sooner. In this blog I will be posting some of the
          workouts me and my brother do together, as well as some of the recipes
          we have created at home and love. We hope you enjoy!

          About Me - Alfredo Acebal
        </h3>
        <p>
          I aspired to be a pro baseball player, and I trained all my high
          school to achieve my optimal physical condition. Hello! My name is
          Alfredo Acebal, and this is my story… Since my teenage years, in which
          I went to finish my high school degree abroad at IMG Academies in
          Bradenton, Florida, I have been concerned with my health and fitness.
          Becoming a baseball player involved healthy nutrition, intense
          training, and a balanced mindset. My day consisted of baseball,
          training, eating, studying, and sleeping. However, as the years passed
          I became more involved in the family business and training and
          baseball were not necessarily the top priority. Finding time to fit an
          8-5 job while playing and training was too complicated.
          Notwithstanding that, my dream of becoming pro seemed farther and
          farther every day. This being said, I went abroad again to Boston,
          Massachusetts to pursue my undergraduate career at Suffolk University.
          At the time, this is what I thought: “I have spent so much of my time
          and energy into training, and I did not make it, so this lifestyle of
          mine is over”. My days now consisted of eating unhealthy and watching
          television. It was a shocking transformation for me and for those who
          surrounded me as well. Six years passed, and I had not stepped foot on
          a gym or on a baseball field. Physically, I looked unhealthy;
          mentally, I was not happy with my habits and who I had let myself
          become. I was handling too much stress, but I was not coping with it
          in a healthy way. Now, at the age of 26, I am the best version of
          myself. About a year ago, I reintroduced myself in the gym, and about
          4 months ago I started what would be the best lifestyle I could
          follow. It all started by acknowledging the connotation of the word
          “diet” and making sure I said “lifestyle” every time I thought of
          this. I have to recognize, however, that the process has not been
          easy. Getting back on track to becoming the best version of myself
          physically and mentally has been a long journey involving all my
          commitment, dedication, and constancy. And that has been my biggest
          lesson through this all: there will be hard days, but slow and steady
          wins the race. What my sister and I have created here in terms of
          content, we hope will inspire you and motivate you to start become
          your best version yet, and to make sure it lasts! We hope you enjoy!
