        About Me - Mariella Acebal

        Hello! My name is Mariella Acebal and I am 20 years old. The purpose of
        telling you my story is to tell you a bit about myself and my background
        as well as how I got so passionate about pursuing a healthy lifestyle. I
        hope my workouts and recipes serve as inspiration and motivation to
        start taking care of your body and health.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in the Dominican Republic, and then I moved to
        Boston, Massachusetts to pursue my undergraduate degree at Babson
        College. Since high school, I battled a lot with my weight and with the
        way I felt with my body. After trying all types of fad diets, no matter
        how much exercise I did, I never seemed to shed the weight I wanted off.
        I was then diagnosed with hypothyroidism and prescribed some pills that
        would regulate my body hormones. In my ideal world, this was the recipe
        to shed all the weight I had previously wanted to. Little did I know
        that this was not the solution. Transitioning into college and living
        abroad for the first time was very stressful and my body started this
        rollercoaster weight loss and weight gain process. Due to this, I began
        all these fad diets once again and changed them every week because I
        never saw the results I wanted. Fast forward three years, and I am now
        where I wanted to be years ago and in the best mental and physical
        condition I have ever been.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have learned a lot throughout this long journey. Most importantly,
        that it takes time, effort, and consistency to achieve your goals. All
        the extreme fad diets I was doing, such as living on protein only for 20
        days or even a caloric deficit of about 500 calories a day, were
        definitely not the right way to lose weight mentally and to perform well
        physically. About three months ago, amid the Coronavirus pandemic that I
        had to travel back home, my brother inspired me to start changing my
        mindset. He made me see what I considered “dieting” a lifestyle. Once I
        accepted this, my transformation has been tremendous. Mentally, I am
        more aware of how my body feels and less worried about the number on the
        scale. Physically, I am eating the foods that allow me to perform with
        the best energy during my long runs and workouts, and my body looks
        leaner every day. With this I get to my main point: our body needs us to
        be patient, and our minds can be our worst enemy at times. We have to
        learn to control our minds and to love our bodies. It took me too much
        time to realize this, and I just hope that my story helps you realize
        this sooner.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this blog I will be posting some of the workouts me and my brother do
        together, as well as some of the recipes we have created at home and
        love. We hope you enjoy!
